Django Templates
================

Basic registration templates for a Django project! How many times should one start from scratch?!  
These templates, although basic, do give a head-start to django's user authentication system implementation.

This work is derived from [django-allauth](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth) [templates](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth/tree/master/allauth/templates).
Translation is supported by default.

**NOTE** - The templates have not been tested yet!
